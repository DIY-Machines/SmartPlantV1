# SmartPlantV1
Automatic Smart Plant Pot - (DIY, 3d Printed, Arduino, Self Watering, Project)


Print, assemble and program your own intelligent Smart Plant Pot. With a hidden water reservoir, pump and sensors why not make your plant care easy.

With an Arduino Nano at its core this project uses a water level sensor to let you know when to refill the concealed tank and a solid moisture sensor to figure out when to water your plant based on its needs.
